/**
 * Provides quantitative properties or attributes of thing such as
 * mass, time, distance, heat, and angular separation.
 * Quantities of different kinds are represented by sub-types of the
 * {@link javax.measure.Quantity} interface, which can be
 * created by a new {@link org.eclipse.uomo.units.impl.BaseAmount} instance or its subclasses.
 *
 * <p> Only quantities defined in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_System_of_Units">International System of Units</a>
 *     are provided here. Users can create their own quantity types by extending the {@link
 *     javax.measure.Quantity Quantity} interface.</p>
 *
 * <p> This package supports <cite>measurable</cite> quantities, which can be
 *     expressed as ({@link java.lang.Number}, {@link javax.measure.Unit}) tuples.
 *     Those tuples are not expected to be used directly in numerically intensive code.
 *     They are more useful as metadata converted to the application internal representation
 *     (for example {@code double} primitive type with the requirement to provide values in
 *     metres) before the computation begin. For this purpose, the {@code Quantity} interface
 *     provides the {@code longValue(Unit<Q>)} and {@code doubleValue(Unit<Q>)} convenience
 *     methods. Example:[code]
 *        TimeAmount calculateTravelTime(Length distance, Speed Speed) {
 *            double seconds = distance.doubleValue(METRE) /
 *                             Speed.doubleValue(METRE_PER_SECOND);
 *            return new TimeAmount(seconds, SECOND);
 *        }
 *     [/code]
 * </p>
 *
 * <p> Quantities sub-types are also used as parameterized type to characterize generic
 *     classes (and provide additional compile time check) as illustrated here.[code]
 *        Sensor<Temperature> sensor ... // Generic sensor.
 *        Temperature temp = sensor.getValue();
 *        MassAmount mass = new MassAmount(180, POUND); // Combination magnitude/precision/unit (measurement)
 *        Vector3D<Speed> aircraftSpeed = new Vector3D(12.0, 34.0, -45.5, METRE_PER_SECOND);
 *     [/code]</p>
 *
 * <p> This package holds only the quantities required by the metric system.</p>
